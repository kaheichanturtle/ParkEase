ParkEase is an open-source, browser-based parking timer that uses AI to interpret parking signs and automatically set a timer for you. Just take a photo, and you're set.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Sign Reading**: Snap a photo of any parking sign, and our AI handles the rest.
- **Smart Background Timer**: Timer keeps running even if your phone is locked. Alerts you 15 minutes before time is up.
- **GPS & Maps**: Automatically saves your parked location so you can find your car later.
- **Parking History**: View a log of past parked locations.
- **No App Required**: Works entirely in your browser.
- **Fully Private**: No accounts, no tracking, no servers. Data is stored only on your device via LocalStorage.
- **Open Source**: Everythingâ€™s public and inspectable.
