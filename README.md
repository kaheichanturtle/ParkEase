## Core Features

- **AI-Powered Sign Analysis**: Instantly decode complex parking rules based on the current time and day, factoring in complex restrictions.
- **Automatic Background Timer**: Utilizes a privacy-focused MediaTick/silent audio method to ensure the timer runs reliably in the background, even when the phone is locked. Alerts you 15 minutes before time expires.
- **GPS Location Saving**: Automatically saves your exact parking spot location so you can find your car later with a single tap.
- **Privacy First**: No user accounts, no sign-ups, and absolutely no data leaves your device. All information is stored securely on your device via LocalStorage.
- **Browser Native**: No app installation required. Works entirely in modern mobile browsers.
- **Open Source**: The full source code is available for inspection and auditing.
