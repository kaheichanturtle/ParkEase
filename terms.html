<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We prioritize your privacy. Here’s how we handle your data:</p>

<h3>Purpose of Data Usage</h3>
<p>We do not store, process, or retain any personal or identifiable information. Everything stays private and on your device.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Services</h3>

<h3>Data Protection</h3>
<p>We take privacy seriously. However, we recommend avoiding entering sensitive personal details into the app to ensure your privacy and security.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>While we aim to protect your privacy, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed due to the nature of AI data processing. Always use discretion when using the service.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
