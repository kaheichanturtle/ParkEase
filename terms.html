  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p>Welcome to ParkEase. We are absolutely delighted and genuinely pleased to offer you this innovative tool that has been designed with the specific aim of assisting you in navigating the often incredibly complex and frequently confusing landscape of parking regulations and restrictions. Before you fully embark on using ParkEase and integrate it into your daily routine, we very kindly and strongly request that you take the necessary time to carefully read through these comprehensive terms and conditions in their entirety. By downloading, installing, accessing, or simply continuing to use the ParkEase mobile application (hereinafter referred to as "the App"), you are clearly and unequivocally signifying your absolute and legally binding agreement to be fully bound by these terms and conditions from this point forward. This document meticulously outlines the foundational principles governing your permitted use of the App and explicitly clarifies the respective rights and responsibilities of both you, the valued user, and Shellcraft Studios, the dedicated independent developer. It is truly essential to understand that these terms collectively constitute a legally binding agreement between yourself and Shellcraft Studios. If you find that you do not agree with any single part, clause, or condition presented within these terms, you must immediately cease using the App without delay and proceed to uninstall it from your device promptly.</p>
  <p>In essence, our fundamental and core philosophy, which underpins every aspect of the App's design and functionality, is built squarely around safeguarding your privacy and ensuring you retain complete control over your personal information. ParkEase has been meticulously designed and developed to function entirely on your local device without relying on any remote servers whatsoever for storing your personal data, usage information, or any other sensitive details. All pertinent data that the App generates or uses, such as your diligently saved parking locations, historical records of scanned signs, and your configured timer settings, resides exclusively and securely on your local device's internal storage. There is absolutely no cloud storage utilised by us, no form of tracking of your activities or behaviour within the App performed by Shellcraft Studios, and absolutely no unnecessary collection of your personal details whatsoever. You retain full, absolute, and unequivocal custodianship and control of your information at all times it is within the App's scope.</p>

  <h3>Project Disclaimer and Nature of the App</h3>
  <p>Please be profoundly aware and fully understand that ParkEase is fundamentally a passion project and remains very much a work-in-progress that is under continuous, ongoing development and refinement by a single, independent creator operating solely under the name Shellcraft Studios. As such, the App is provided to you strictly on an "as is" and "as available" basis, explicitly without any warranties, guarantees, or formal commitments of any kind regarding its performance, reliability, or suitability for any specific purpose. Features, functionalities, user interface elements, underlying algorithms (including any integrated artificial intelligence models), and the overall performance of the App are all entirely subject to potential change, significant refinement, or even complete removal as we iteratively develop, test, and strive to improve the App based on technical considerations, user feedback, and available resources. While we sincerely endeavour to provide a reliable and genuinely helpful tool to the very best of our individual ability, the inherent nature of independent software development, particularly for projects undertaken by a single developer, means that we simply cannot guarantee uninterrupted service, entirely bug-free operation, or perfect functionality at all times under all conditions. It is quite possible that you may encounter bugs, errors, inaccuracies, or unexpected behaviour during your use of the App. Your explicit decision to download and use the App acknowledges and fully accepts this developmental state and the inherent limitations and potential imperfections that regrettably come with it.</p>

  <h3>Limitations of AI Models</h3>
  <p>ParkEase incorporates sophisticated artificial intelligence models, specifically designed with the intention of assisting with the analysis and interpretation of parking signage based on images that you voluntarily choose to provide. While these models represent powerful technological tools with significant capabilities, it is absolutely crucial to understand that they are not infallible and should under no circumstances be considered a definitive, absolute, or authoritative source on local parking regulations or bylaws. The accuracy of the AI's interpretation can be significantly and negatively affected by numerous external factors that are often beyond our control, including but not limited to: the quality, resolution, angle, and lighting conditions of the photograph you capture; regional or local variations in sign design, language, and formatting; the complex presence of multiple, layered, or potentially conflicting signs within a single image; and the inherent limitations of current artificial intelligence technology in sophisticated visual parsing, nuanced contextual understanding, and accounting for real-world complexities like temporary restrictions. Consequently, the AI may occasionally, or even frequently in challenging conditions, misinterpret signs, provide incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information, or offer suggestions that are not applicable, outdated, or non-compliant with specific local laws, regulations, or temporary restrictions. It is therefore absolutely paramount and your sole responsibility that you understand that any information or suggestion provided by the AI within ParkEase is intended strictly for informational assistance only and should be treated merely as a helpful guide, not as a definitive or legally binding ruling. You are solely and entirely responsible for independently verifying the accuracy and applicability of any AI output against the actual physical signage present at your location and the prevailing local parking regulations and bylaws. Reliance solely on the AI's interpretation without careful independent verification is done entirely and exclusively at your own risk and peril. Shellcraft Studios shall not be held responsible, liable, or accountable for any fines, penalties, damages, towing fees, or any other negative consequences whatsoever arising from or related to incorrect AI interpretations, errors in analysis, or your subsequent reliance thereupon. By using the AI feature of the App, you expressly and unconditionally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Shellcraft Studios from any claims, legal actions, or liabilities stemming from such errors or reliance on the AI's output.</p>

  <h3>Device Compatibility and Timer Accuracy</h3>
  <p>The timer functionality incorporated within ParkEase is specifically designed to assist you in diligently tracking parking durations and relies heavily on your device's internal clock and sophisticated mechanisms for managing countdowns based on internal timing processes. This functionality has undergone rigorous testing on a range of devices and has demonstrated reliable performance in those testing environments. However, the vast and incredibly diverse ecosystem of mobile devices, numerous operating system versions, device-specific configurations, the presence of background processes from other applications, and the varying power management settings implemented by different manufacturers mean that we simply cannot guarantee perfect, unvarying performance and absolute, millisecond-level timer accuracy across every single device model or configuration imaginable. Minor discrepancies or delays in timer accuracy may potentially occur due to a multitude of factors that are often entirely outside of the App's direct control or influence, including but not limited to: system clock drift over time, performance impacts or delays caused by other applications running concurrently in the background, scheduled background tasks, or aggressive power-saving modes implemented by the operating system or the device manufacturer to conserve battery life. The timer should therefore be treated as a helpful supplementary guide to assist you in managing your parking time, rather than an absolutely precise scientific instrument. We strongly and emphatically advise that you manually verify the remaining permitted time using a reliable physical clock or your device's standard time display, especially as you approach the potential expiry of your permitted parking duration. Never rely exclusively or solely on the ParkEase timer as your only means of avoiding incurring parking fines or penalties. Shellcraft Studios explicitly disclaims any and all liability and responsibility for fines, penalties, towing fees, or other negative consequences resulting from timer inaccuracies, discrepancies, or your failure to independently and manually monitor your parking duration.</p>

  <h3>User Responsibility and Compliance</h3>
  <p>ParkEase is offered strictly and unequivocally as a supplementary tool intended to assist you in managing your parking considerations and improving your awareness. It is under no circumstances whatsoever a substitute for your own essential vigilance, your personal understanding of applicable local laws and regulations, or your fundamental responsibility for responsible and lawful behaviour. The ultimate and sole responsibility for understanding, complying with, and rigorously adhering to all applicable local, regional, and national parking laws, regulations, restrictions, bylaws, and displayed signage rests solely and entirely with you, the user, and nobody else. You are exclusively responsible for accurately inputting information into the App where required, critically interpreting the output received from the AI (always cross-referencing it with real-world signs and official regulations), diligently monitoring the timer, and ultimately making final, informed, and responsible decisions regarding your parking actions. The App absolutely does not provide legal advice, nor does it guarantee immunity from parking enforcement actions or the imposition of penalties. By using ParkEase, you explicitly acknowledge and accept that you are exercising your own independent judgment, voluntarily assuming all risks associated with parking in any public or private areas, and accepting full and complete responsibility for your actions and their consequences. Shellcraft Studios accepts absolutely no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any fines, penalties, towing fees, damages, or any other negative consequences whatsoever resulting from your parking decisions, actions, or failure to comply with applicable regulations, regardless of whether you were using the App at the time of the incident or decision.</p>

  <h3>Data Usage, Storage, and Your Privacy</h3>
  <p>A cornerstone of the ParkEase design and its core development philosophy is our unwavering and absolute commitment to safeguarding your privacy. It is not merely an afterthought or a feature added later, but a fundamental principle that has guided every technical decision and design choice from the App's very inception. This Privacy Policy outlines our rigorous practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information within the specific context of your use of the App. To put it plainly and perhaps surprisingly: our practice is to collect virtually nothing significant or identifying about you or your usage patterns through the App's operation.</p>
  <p>Our steadfast commitment to your privacy is demonstrated unequivocally and transparently by our policy of not collecting, storing, or transmitting any personal data from you as a user of ParkEase to Shellcraft Studios or any other party (with the sole, clearly defined exception of the AI feature as noted below and in the terms). When you use the App, your activities performed within the App, the parking information you choose to input or save, your application settings, and any other data directly related to your usage are generated and stored exclusively and securely on your local device's internal storage. We absolutely do not receive, process, or retain any data whatsoever that could personally identify you as an individual or allow us to track your behaviour, habits, or usage patterns within the App. There are no hidden analytics trackers embedded by us, no usage monitoring performed remotely by Shellcraft Studios, and absolutely no transmission of your personal information to our servers (primarily because we do not operate servers for this kind of data collection). The only singular and specific instance where data potentially leaves your device within the core App functionality occurs when you actively choose to utilise the AI sign recognition feature, which necessitates sending an image of a parking sign directly from your device to Google's AI platform for computational processing and analysis, as detailed further below and reiterated clearly in the Terms and Conditions.</p>
  <p>The singular exception to data leaving your device within the App's primary functionality occurs specifically when you elect to submit a photograph of a parking sign for analysis by the integrated AI. To process this image and provide an interpretation of the sign's content, the image you capture is securely transmitted directly from your device to Google's AI services for the required processing. This secure transmission is absolutely essential and necessary for the AI feature to function and provide its intended output. However, it is absolutely crucial for your understanding and peace of mind to note that this data transmission occurs directly and solely between your device and Google's services; Shellcraft Studios does not in any way intercept, store, process, or have access to these transmitted images at any point during or after the process. The handling, processing, and any potential temporary retention of these images by Google are governed entirely by Google's own comprehensive terms of service and privacy policies, over which we have no control or influence. We strongly recommend and advise you to review Google's relevant documentation for detailed information on their data practices when interacting with their platforms and AI services. Your voluntary use of the AI feature within ParkEase constitutes your explicit acknowledgment, understanding, and consent to this specific transmission of images directly to Google for processing as described.</p>

  <h3>Identity of Shellcraft Studios and Dispute Resolution</h3>
  <p>ParkEase is a project that has been developed, maintained, and is provided by an individual operating solely under the informal moniker "Shellcraft Studios." It is critically important to clarify and understand that Shellcraft Studios is not a registered company, a formal corporate entity, a legal partnership, or any other form of legally recognised business structure whatsoever. It represents purely the independent effort, personal time, and passion project of a single, dedicated developer. As a direct result of this status, the legal structure, formal obligations, and potential liabilities typically associated with a registered business or corporation simply do not apply to Shellcraft Studios. This distinct status further underscores that the App is provided as a personal project undertaken without formal warranties, without extensive corporate backing, and without the infrastructure or capacity for engaging in formal legal disputes. While every sincere effort is made to ensure the quality of the App, address reported issues, and respond to user feedback to the best of an individual's ability, the developer's capacity, time, and resources are fundamentally those of a single individual operating in good faith and enthusiasm for the project.</p>
  <p>Explicit Legal Disclaimer: Due to the fundamental nature of this project and the specific status of Shellcraft Studios as an independent, non-corporate, and informal entity, it is hereby explicitly and unequivocally stated, understood, and agreed by you as a condition of using this App that no legal action whatsoever is permitted, possible, or viable in relation to this App or any issues, consequences, or outcomes arising directly or indirectly from its download, installation, use, or reliance upon any information it provides. This absolute prohibition includes, but is not limited to, any and all claims related to the App's functionality, the accuracy of any information it presents, its design elements (such as images, fonts, colour schemes, layout, or graphical assets), its performance, or any fines, penalties, damages, or any other consequences whatsoever stemming from your reliance on or use of the App for any purpose. By using ParkEase, you expressly and unconditionally agree to forever waive any and all right to pursue legal proceedings, litigation, or any form of formal legal action against Shellcraft Studios or the individual developer behind it. Furthermore, we explicitly and definitively state that we will not attend court, engage legal representation, respond to legal demands, or participate in any formal legal dispute resolution processes for issues arising from any part of the product or its use, whether it relates to specific images used, fonts, colour choices, functionality, accuracy, or any other aspect whatsoever. Your affirmative acceptance of these terms and continued use of the App constitutes a binding and irreversible agreement to seek resolution of any concerns or issues amicably and entirely outside of the formal legal system.</p>
  <p>However, in the genuine spirit of cooperation, good faith, and with a clear intention to respect intellectual property rights and avoid unnecessary conflict, should any part of the App, such as its design elements (including images, fonts, or colour palettes) or specific content, be genuinely deemed problematic, infringing upon, or causing legitimate concern to the rights of another corporation, organisation, or individual rights holder, we are certainly willing to address such concerns directly and constructively. We will gladly consider and, where it is appropriate, feasible, and practical for an independent developer with limited resources, endeavour to change or remove certain elements if it is clearly demonstrated to us that it constitutes a legitimate problem or causes genuine concern to another corporation or rights holder. This willingness is contingent upon the concern being communicated to us directly, clearly, and amicably, entirely bypassing any formal legal channels or threats. Our overriding goal is to provide a useful and enjoyable tool while respecting others' rights and intellectual property, and we strongly prefer cooperative and amicable solutions over confrontational or litigious ones.</p>

  <h3>Acceptance of Terms and Modifications</h3>
  <p>By downloading, installing, accessing, or definitively continuing to use ParkEase after accessing or reviewing these terms and conditions, you are formally indicating your full understanding, explicit acknowledgment, and unconditional acceptance of all clauses, conditions, and disclaimers contained within this document. These terms collectively constitute the entire and complete agreement between you and Shellcraft Studios regarding your use of the App, entirely superseding any prior agreements, understandings, or communications, whether oral or written. If you find that you fundamentally disagree with any part of these terms, including specifically the explicit disclaimers regarding legal action and liability, your sole, exclusive, and only permitted remedy is to immediately discontinue your use of the App without delay and uninstall it completely from your device. Shellcraft Studios explicitly reserves the right to modify, update, amend, or change these terms and conditions at any time in the future, entirely at its sole discretion and potentially without prior notice to you. Any such changes or revisions will become effective immediately upon the posting of the revised terms on this page within the App or on the associated website. While we may endeavour to highlight particularly significant changes where possible and practical, it remains your personal and ongoing responsibility to review these terms periodically and regularly to stay fully informed of any updates or modifications. Your continued use of the App following the posting of any changes will constitute your binding and undeniable acceptance of those revised terms and conditions.</p>

  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>At Shellcraft Studios, we genuinely hold your privacy in the absolute highest regard. It is not merely an afterthought or a regulatory checkbox for us, but a fundamental and core principle that has guided the design and development of ParkEase from its very inception. This Privacy Policy meticulously outlines our clear and transparent practices regarding the collection, use, and potential disclosure of information within the specific context of your use of the App. As a brief summary, or perhaps a welcome spoiler alert: our fundamental practice and design choice is to collect virtually nothing significant or personally identifiable about you when you use the App.</p>
  <p>Our steadfast and demonstrable commitment to preserving your privacy is showcased unequivocally by our explicit policy of not collecting, storing, or transmitting any personal data from you as a user of ParkEase to Shellcraft Studios or any other entity (with the single, clearly defined exception related to the AI feature as noted below). When you actively use the App, your activities performed within the App interface, the parking information you choose to input or save for later reference, your selected application settings, and any other data directly related to your usage are generated and stored exclusively, and we must stress, only, on your local device's secure storage. We absolutely do not receive, process, or retain any data whatsoever on our end that could personally identify you as an individual user or allow us to track your specific behaviour, preferences, or usage patterns within the App. There are no hidden third-party analytics trackers embedded by us, no usage monitoring performed remotely by Shellcraft Studios, and absolutely no transmission of your personal or usage information to our servers (primarily because we do not operate servers for the purpose of collecting user data from this App). The only isolated and specific instance where data potentially leaves your device within the App's core functionality occurs solely when you actively choose to utilise the AI sign recognition feature, which inherently necessitates sending an image of a parking sign directly from your device to Google's AI platform for computational processing and analysis, as detailed further below and reiterated clearly in the App's Terms and Conditions.</p>
  <p>As clearly mentioned and explained in the accompanying Terms and Conditions, ParkEase integrates with one specific third-party service, namely Google's AI platform, exclusively for the purpose of performing the image analysis of parking signs that you voluntarily choose to submit via the App's interface. When you choose to utilise this particular feature, the image you capture using your device's camera is securely and directly transmitted from your device to Google's services for the required processing and interpretation. This direct transmission is absolutely essential and technically necessary for the AI feature to function and provide its intended output interpretation. However, it is critically important for you to understand that this data transmission occurs directly and solely between your device and Google's services; Shellcraft Studios does not in any way act as an intermediary, intercept, store, process, or have access to these transmitted images at any point during or after the analysis process by Google. The subsequent handling, processing, and any potential temporary retention of these images by Google are governed entirely and exclusively by Google's own comprehensive terms of service and privacy policies, over which we, Shellcraft Studios, have no control, influence, or visibility. We strongly recommend and advise you to review Google's relevant documentation for detailed information on their specific data practices when interacting with their platforms and AI services. Your voluntary use of the AI feature within ParkEase constitutes your explicit acknowledgment, full understanding, and unconditional consent to this specific transmission of images directly to Google for processing as described.</p>
  <p>Given the fundamental design choice that your personal data, usage information, and saved settings are stored only on your local device and are not transmitted to or stored on our servers or systems, the inherent risk of unauthorised access or data breaches originating directly from Shellcraft Studios is fundamentally eliminated by this design principle. The security and privacy of your data within ParkEase are therefore largely, if not entirely, dependent on the security measures and practices you personally employ on your own device (e.g., setting strong device passcodes, enabling device encryption features, keeping your operating system and other applications updated). While ParkEase itself is conscientiously designed to be private by default and intentionally minimises external data transmission, we simply cannot protect data residing on a device that is compromised through other means or vulnerabilities entirely unrelated to the App itself. For this important reason, and although the App is not designed for handling highly sensitive personal information, we strongly advise against entering or storing any highly sensitive, confidential, or critical data within ParkEase as a general security best practice that applies universally to any application on your device, regardless of its privacy design.</p>
  <p>It is important for you to recognise and acknowledge that while ParkEase prioritises local data storage and is designed to minimise external interactions where possible, no digital system involving any degree of interaction with external, online services can ever be guaranteed as 100% private, secure, or infallible in all conceivable circumstances. The transmission of images directly to Google's AI service, while designed to be secure and direct from your device, does introduce an external point of interaction that is governed entirely by Google's policies and infrastructure. Although we, Shellcraft Studios, do not handle this data ourselves, the act of sending any data to a third party inherently carries some degree of potential, however minimal or theoretical. We therefore strongly encourage all users to exercise discretion and thoughtful judgment when using the AI feature, and to specifically avoid uploading images that may inadvertently contain personal information, are captured in highly sensitive locations, or include anything you would be uncomfortable being processed by a third-party service, even if that service is Google and governed by their own policies, should you have any concerns about third-party processing whatsoever.</p>
  <p>Shellcraft Studios expressly reserves the right to update, modify, or amend this Privacy Policy periodically in the future to accurately reflect any changes in our practices regarding the App, updates to the App's functionality, underlying technological changes, or evolving legal and regulatory requirements. Any such revisions or amendments will be promptly posted on this page within the App or on the associated website, with an updated "Last Updated" date clearly indicated at the top of the policy. While we may attempt to notify users of particularly significant changes through updates to the App or other means where feasible and practical for an independent developer, it is ultimately and solely your responsibility to review this policy from time to time to remain fully informed about how your privacy is protected (or rather, how your data isn't collected by us) by ParkEase. Your continued use of ParkEase following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your binding and unconditional acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

  <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

  <h3>Understanding Cookies in the Context of ParkEase</h3>
  <p>Cookies are typically small text files that websites or online services store on a user's browser or device for various purposes, such as remembering information about their visit, recalling preferences, or maintaining login status for future interactions. ParkEase, as a standalone native mobile application primarily designed for offline or local functionality where possible, does not directly use, set, or manage any cookies on your device for its core operational functionality. We do not track your usage within the app, remember your settings, or store preferences using cookies controlled by Shellcraft Studios. Our internal approach relies entirely and exclusively on utilising your device's local storage capabilities to manage app state and user preferences.</p>
  <p>However, as clearly detailed and explained in both the accompanying Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy, the App does utilise Google's AI platform for the specific purpose of performing the image analysis of parking signs that you voluntarily choose to submit via the App's interface. While ParkEase itself does not employ cookies for its own purposes, it is possible, and indeed likely, that Google's services, when accessed for the AI analysis via direct application programming interface (API) calls, may employ cookies or similar tracking technologies on their end within their infrastructure. These might be used by Google for various purposes such as maintaining service performance, conducting internal analytics related to the usage and improvement of their AI models, or fulfilling other operational or technical necessities as defined and governed solely by Google's own comprehensive policies. It is crucial to understand that any such potential cookies or tracking mechanisms are associated directly and exclusively with Google's service, not with the ParkEase application or Shellcraft Studios itself, and are handled entirely within Google's infrastructure according to their established rules and practices. We have absolutely no visibility into or control over any such mechanisms Google may choose to employ.</p>

  <h3>Managing Third-Party Cookies</h3>
  <p>If you wish to control or manage cookies in general, including those potentially used by third-party services like Google when you interact with them through any application or web browser, you would typically manage these settings through your device's web browser settings, your personal Google account settings, or specific privacy controls provided directly by the service provider if they make such options available. Please note that adjusting cookie settings primarily affects web Browse experiences and interactions with online services performed through a standard web browser. While managing cookies through your device or browser settings might influence how external services like Google's AI platform function in general web contexts, it is unlikely to directly affect the specific, technical image transmission functionality occurring within the ParkEase app, as this often involves direct application programming interface (API) calls which may not be subject to standard browser cookie controls. However, if you have general concerns about cookies or tracking technologies used by Google or other online services, you should refer directly to Google's own documentation and privacy resources on managing cookies and privacy controls relevant to their services. ParkEase's core functions, which as stated rely exclusively on local device storage and not cookies, will not be impacted by your browser's cookie settings.</p>

  <h3>Changes to This Cookie Policy</h3>
  <p>This Cookie Policy may be updated occasionally in the future to accurately reflect any changes in how ParkEase integrates with third-party services or if our technical implementation changes in a fundamental way that would necessitate the use of cookies directly by the App itself (though, as stated, we do not currently anticipate using cookies for core App functionality). Any such revisions will be promptly posted on this page within the App or on the associated website with an updated date clearly indicated at the top of the policy. Your continued use of ParkEase following the posting of any changes to this Cookie Policy constitutes your binding and unconditional acceptance of the revised policy. Should you have any questions or require clarification regarding this policy or any other aspect of the App's terms, please feel free to seek further information through the contact methods provided (if any) by Shellcraft Studios.</p>
